     cccmac_sl_test_xor
     is the multiplication of S and 0...010 (x) in the finite field
     represented using the primitive polynomial
     x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1.

     "2" is the hexadecimal representation of the polynomial "x".
     Therefore the multiplication by "x" is refered as "doubling" in RFC 5297

     The operation on a 128-bit input string is performed using a
     left-shift of the input followed by a conditional xor operation on
     the result with the constant:

     00000000 00000000 00000000 00000087

     The condition under which the xor operation is performed is when the
     bit being shifted off is one.
