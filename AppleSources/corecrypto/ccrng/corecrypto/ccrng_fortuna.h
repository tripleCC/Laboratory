// This is a Fortuna-inspired PRNG. While it differs from Fortuna in
// many minor details, the biggest difference is its support for
// multiple independent output generators. This is to make it suitable
// for use in concurrent environments.
//
// This PRNG targets a 256-bit security level.
//
// First, the user should call ccrng_fortuna_init. The user must
// specify the maximum number of output generators that might be
// needed. (Typically, users should align this argument with the
// number of available CPUs.)
//
// The user must also provide a read-only handle to an entropy
// source. This is a fixed-size buffer that will receive entropy
// updates out of band from the PRNG (e.g. in an interrupt
// handler). The PRNG will consume entropy from this buffer according
// to an internal schedule driven by calls to ccrng_fortuna_refresh
// (see below).
//
// The user should call ccrng_fortuna_initgen for as many output
// generators as are needed. The numeric argument is an identifier to
// be reused during calls to ccrng_fortuna_generate (see below) and
// must be less than the maximum number of generators specified to
// ccrng_fortuna_init.
//
// After initialization, the user is free to call
// ccrng_fortuna_generate to generate random bytes. The user must
// specify the generator in this call using a numeric identifier
// passed in the call to ccrng_fortuna_initgen.
//
// Output generation is limited to 256 bytes per request. Users should
// make multiple requests if more output is needed.
//
// The user is expected to call ccrng_fortuna_refresh regularly. This
// function consumes entropy and mixes it into the output generators
// according to an internal schedule.
//
// This implementation is thread-safe. Internally, a set of mutexes
// guard access to internal state. Most functions rely on a single
// mutex to protect shared state. The main exception is the
// ccrng_fortuna_generate function, which uses a per-generator mutex
// to allow concurrent output generation on different threads.
//
// Another important exception is ccrng_fortuna_refresh. While this
// function relies on the shared mutex, it returns immediately if it
// cannot acquire it.
//
// The PRNG also supports user-initiated reseeds. This is to support a
// user-writable random device.
//
// This PRNG supports reseeds concurrent with output generation,
// i.e. it is safe to call ccrng_fortuna_reseed or
// ccrng_fortuna_refresh while another thread is calling
// ccrng_fortuna_generate.
