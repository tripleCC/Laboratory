// This is a ccrng wrapper for the getentropy(2) system call. (See its
// man page for further details.)
//
// getentropy(2) is a simple interface to the kernel RNG. While the
// kernel RNG does reseed frequently, it cannot provide full-entropy
// outputs exceeding the security level of the underlying
// deterministic generator. It also cannot guarantee prediction
// resistance across successive requests.
//
// We mitigate these issues in corecrypto by polling getentropy(2)
// frequently for fresh entropy as the kernel RNG reseeds itself.
//
// This instance is not intended for clients external to
// corecrypto. Instead, see ccrng().
//
// This RNG instance will abort on failure (which should never
// happen).
//
// Note that this instance handles any necessary "chunking" of
// requests, i.e. the maximum request size of getentropy(2) is not
// enforced.
