 @discussion
 This function returns a pointer to the most appropriate RNG for the
 environment.

 In SEP, kernel space, and user space, we guarantee 256-bit security;
 contact us regarding other environments.

 The RNG may be a TRNG if one is available. Otherwise, it is
 a PRNG offering several features:
 - Good performance
 - FIPS Compliant: NIST SP800-90A + FIPS 140-2
 - Seeded from the appropriate entropy source for the platform
 - Provides at least 128-bit security
 - Backtracing resistance
 - Prediction break (after reseed)
