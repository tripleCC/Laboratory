// This is a ccrng wrapper for Intel's RDRAND instruction, which is a
// simple interface to a hardware DRNG. See Intel's documentation for
// more information.
//
// This instance is not intended for direct use by clients external to
// corecrypto. Instead, see ccrng().
//
// This RNG instance will return CCERR_NOT_SUPPORTED on platforms that
// do not support RDRAND. This includes all ARM processors and older
// Intel processors. (At this time, Apple does not support any Intel
// processors that do not implement RDRAND.)
//
// Note that this instance handles any necessary "chunking" of
// requests. It also transparently retries in case of ephemeral RDRAND
// failures; this is as recommended by Intel.
