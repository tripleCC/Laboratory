 The r_size argument is really meant to be a size_t rather than a cc_size.  It's the size
 in bytes of the key for which this encoding is being done.  'r' on the other hand is a
 cc_unit array large enough to contain the blocksize of the key.  We need to build up the
 encoding "right justified" within r for r_size bytes.  We'll zero-pad the front and then
 at the end of this routine we'll use ccn_swap() to make it a big number.
