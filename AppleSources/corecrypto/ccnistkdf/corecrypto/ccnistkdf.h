 Perform a NIST SP800-108 KDF in Counter Mode with an AES-CMAC PRF.

 @param cbc An AES-CBC mode.
 @param r The bit length of the counter i.
 @param kdk_nbytes Key Derivation Key Length
 @param kdk Key derivation key, a key that is used as an input to a key derivation function
 (along with other input data) to derive keying material.
 @param label_nbytes Label length
 @param label A string that identifies the purpose for the derived keying material,
 which is encoded as a binary string. The encoding method for the Label
 is defined in a larger context, for example, in the protocol that uses a KDF.
 @param context_nbytes Context length
 @param context A binary string containing the information related to the derived keying material.
 It may include identities of parties who are deriving and/or using the derived
 keying material and, optionally, a nonce known by the parties who derive the keys.
 @param dk_nbytes Derived Key Length
 @param dk_len_nbytes The number of bytes used to represent the derived key length. A common value is 4.
 @param dk buffer for the results of the KDF transformation, must be dkLen big
 @return 0 if success, negative values on errors.
