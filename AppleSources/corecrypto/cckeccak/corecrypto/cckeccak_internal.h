/*
 * Implements the Keccak algorithm as described in [FIPS-202](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202) which underlies all the SHA-3
 * functions (hash functions, and extendable-output functions).
 *
 * Keccak is a sponge function: it first absorbs an arbitrarily-long byte-aligned message into the state of the function, after
 * which an arbitrary number of output bytes can be squeezed out of the state.
 *
 * The following API implements the Keccak[c] algorithm (Keccak restricted to a state of 1600 bits), as described in FIPS-202
 * Sec. 5.2.
 *
 * Note that the Keccak state does not keep track of whether the API has been called in order, or that the value of the rate
 * is consistent between the different API calls. Each function in this file should be called only once, in order, and with
 * the same rate; except `cckeccak_absorb_blocks` which can be called multiple times.
 *
 * Example with a rate of 136 and a padding of 0x06:
 *
 * // Initialize.
 * struct cckeccak_state state;
 * cckeccak_init_state(&state);
 *
 * // Optional: absorb some of the blocks of the input.
 * cckeccak_absorb_blocks(&state, 136, 10, input); input += 10 * 136;
 *
 * // Absorb the rest of the input and pad.
 * cckeccak_absorb_and_pad(&state, 136, nbytes, input, 0x06);
 *
 * // Squeeze `out_nbytes` into the output buffer `out`.
 * cckeccak_squeeze(&state, 136, out_nbytes, out);
 *
