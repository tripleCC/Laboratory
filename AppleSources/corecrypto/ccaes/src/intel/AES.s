/*	We build these AES routines as a single module because the routines refer
	to labels in Data.s and it is easier and faster to refer to them as local
	labels.  In my implementations of AES for CommonCrypto, both i386 and
	x86_64 use position-independent code.  For this in-kernel implementation,
	i386 has been converted to absolute addressing, but x86_64 still uses PIC.

	A local label can be referred to with position-independent assembler
	expressions such as "label-base(register)", where <base> is a local label
	whose address has been loaded into <register>.  (On i386, this is typically
	done with the idiom of a call to the next instruction and a pop of that
	return address into a register.)  Without local labels, the references must
	be done using spaces for addresses of "lazy symbols" that are filled in by
	the dynamic loader and loaded by the code that wants the address.

	So the various routines in other files are assembled here via #include
	directives.
