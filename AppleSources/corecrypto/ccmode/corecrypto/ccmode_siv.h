 @discussion In order to  compute SIV_Enc_k(a1,...,am, n, x) where ai is the ith piece of associated data, n is a nonce and x  is a plaintext, we use the following sequence of calls :


 @code
 ccsiv_init(...)
 ccsiv_aad(...)       (may be called zero or more times)
 ccsiv_set_nonce(...)
 ccsiv_crypt(...)
 @endcode

 To reuse the context for additional encryptions, follow this sequence:

 @code
 ccsiv_reset(...)
 ccsiv_aad(...)       (may be called zero or more times)
 ccsiv_set_nonce(...)
 ccsiv_crypt(...)
 @endcode

Importantly, all the bits in the key need to be random. Duplicating a smaller key to achieve a longer key length will result in an insecure implementation.

 @discussion The nonce is a special form of authenticated data. If provided (a call to ccsiv_set_nonce is optional) it allows
 randomization of the ciphertext (preventing deterministic encryption). While the length of the nonce is not limmited, the
 amount of entropy that can be provided is limited by the number of bits in the block of the associated block-cipher.

                                Case 2) Plaintext (buffer should be already allocated and of length ciphertext_length - block_length length

 @discussion Depending on whether mode has been setup to encrypt or decrypt, this function
 1) Encrypts the plaintext given as input in, and provides the ciphertext (which is a concatenation of the cbc-tag
 followed by the encrypted plaintext) as output out. 2) Decrypts plaintext using the input ciphertext at in (which again is the  cbc-tag, followed by encrypted plaintext), and then verifies that the computed tag and provided tags match.

 This function is only called once. If one wishes to compute another (en)/(de)cryption, one resets the state with
 ccsiv_reset, and then begins the process again. There is no way to stream large plaintext/ciphertext inputs into the
 function.

 In the case of a decryption, if there is a failure in verifying the computed tag against the provided tag (embedded int he ciphertext), then a decryption/verification
 failure is returned, and any internally computed plaintexts and tags are zeroed out.
 Lastly the contexts internal state is reset, so that a new decryption/encryption can be commenced.

 Decryption can be done in place in memory by setting in=out. Encryption cannot be done in place. However, if one is trying to minimize memory usage one can set out = in - block_length, which results in the ciphertext being encrypted inplace, and the IV being prepended before the ciphertext.

 one piece of associated data may be provided.

 @param      nonce_nbytes       Length of the current nonce data being added
 @param      nonce              Nonce data to be authenticated.
 @param      adata_nbytes       Length of the associated data.
 @param      adata              Associated data to be authenticated.
 @param      in_nbytes          Length of either the plaintext (for encryption) or ciphertext (for decryption), in the latter case the length includes the length of the tag.
 @param      in                 Plaintext or ciphertext. Note that the ciphertext includes a tag of length tag_length prepended to it.
 @param      out                Buffer to hold ciphertext/plaintext. (Note Ciphertext is of size plaintext_length + block_length and plaintext is of ciphertext_length - block_length, as the tag has the length of one block.
                                Must be the case that out<= in - block length || out>= in + plaintext_length

 @discussion Decryption can be done in place in memory by setting in=out. Encryption cannot be done in place. However, is one is trying to minimize memory usage
 one can set out = in - block_length, which results in the ciphertext being encrypted inplace, and the IV being prepended before the ciphertext.

 Suppose the block length is 16 bytes long (AES) and plaintext of length 20, then we could set in = 16, out = 0 let the bytes of the plaintext be denoted as P_1...P_20
 then memory is depicted as:
            | 0 = ? | 1 = ?  | ... | 15 = ? | 16 = P_1 | ... | 35 = P_20 |
                |       |             |         |                |
                V       V             V         V                V
            |IV_1  | IV_2  | ... | IV_16    |   C_1    | ... |  C_20      |

Note that the ciphrtext itself is encrypted in place, but the IV prefixes the ciphertext.
