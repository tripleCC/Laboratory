# Why not just install these libraries under the link names to begin
# with?
#
# There are a couple issues.

# First, all these links have the same file name but different install
# paths. This should be fine, but the build system puts intermediate
# build artifacts in flat directories and complains if there are name
# collisions.
#
# Second, we build all these libraries as build variants of a single
# target. Xcode's build system only evaluates ${INSTALL_PATH} once and
# not per-variant. This means you can't have different install paths
# for each one.
#
# As a workaround, we build the libraries under unique names and
# create links after the fact.
