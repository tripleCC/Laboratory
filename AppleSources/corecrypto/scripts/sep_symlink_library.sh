# Why not just install these libraries under the link names to begin
# with?
#
# The issue is that we need to build two sets of libraries with the
# same names but different install paths. This should be fine, but the
# build system puts intermediate build artifacts in flat directories
# and complains if there are name collisions.
#
# As a workaround, we build the libraries under unique names and
# create symlinks after the fact.
